  <h1>Case Study: Agile Content Delivery & Release Management — Global Digital Learning Solutions Firm</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Role:</strong> Project Manager · <strong>Duration:</strong> Sep 2022 – Aug 2023 · <strong>Scope:</strong> K–8 curriculum, ~390 modules (3 grades, 8 units per grade)</p>

  <h2>Context / Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    A global digital learning solutions firm was developing a large curriculum project (Grades 3–5). Each grade contained ~130 modules, grouped into 8 units, requiring alignment across Instructional Designers, Design, LMS, QA, US-based content teams, and curriculum directors. Stakeholders included delivery managers, directors, external vendors (audio), and end clients. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The challenge: ensure predictable delivery of hundreds of modules, coordinate across multiple functions, and handle dependencies like workbooks and audio — all within a one-year timeline.
  </p>

  <h2>Agile Approach / Execution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>POC / MVP modules:</strong> Each unit began with a sample module as proof-of-concept, reviewed and approved by the client before scaling.</li>
    <li><strong>Sprint-based delivery:</strong> Modules were built in sprints per unit, following client-approved MVPs.</li>
    <li><strong>Release management:</strong> Each unit acted as a release — undergoing QA against a comprehensive checklist, with approvals across levels before going live.</li>
    <li><strong>Backlog management:</strong> Items that didn’t block release were logged into a <em>Post-Activation Tracker</em> for later maintenance sprints.</li>
    <li><strong>Time-sensitive sprint:</strong> A parallel sprint was run to deliver physical workbooks — ensuring publishing deadlines were met and penalties avoided.</li>
    <li><strong>Vendor integration:</strong> Managed audio vendor to replace AI voiceovers with professional recordings across all modules post-activation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results / Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Delivered ~390 modules across Grades 3–5 within a 12-month timeline.</li>
    <li>Release-based activations allowed predictable delivery — stakeholders received usable increments per unit rather than waiting for full completion.</li>
    <li>Post-Activation Tracker reduced rework during releases, balancing quality with on-time delivery.</li>
    <li>On-time delivery of workbooks avoided penalty clauses and ensured client satisfaction.</li>
    <li>Successful vendor management streamlined audio replacement across all modules post-launch.</li>
  </ul>

    "Structured Agile practices — MVPs, sprints, and incremental releases — gave stakeholders transparency and predictable outcomes in a complex multi-team project."
